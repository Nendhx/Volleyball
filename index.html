            <h1>Volleyball Rules</h1>
            <div class="vbrules">
                <h3>How To Play</h3>
                <p>A volleyball game consists of two teams of six players each, separated by a net. The seven volleyball court positions are setter, middle blocker, outside hitter, opposite hitter, libero, defensive specialist and serving specialist.
                    To start, flip a coin to determine which team serves the ball first.<br>
                    Then the two teams will rally—or hit the ball back and forth over the net—until a fault occurs. There is a maximum of three hits per side.<br>
                    The objective is to score points by sending the ball over the net, grounding it into the opponent’s court.<br>
                    Volleyball matches are made up of sets, typically three or five sets.<br>
                    Three-set matches are two sets to 25 points and a third set to 15 points. Each set must be won by two points. The first team to win two sets is the winner of the match.<br>
                    Five-set matches are four sets to 25 points and a fifth set to 15 points. The team must win by two points unless tournament rules dictate otherwise. The first team to win three sets is the winner.<br>
                </p>
                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>Here are the fundamental, must-know rules of a volleyball game: <br>
                    <li>Only 6 players on the floor at any given time: 3 in the front row and 3 in the back row.</li>
                    <li>Points are made on every serve for the winning team of the rally (rally-point scoring).</li>
                    <li>Players may not hit the ball twice in succession (a block is not considered a hit).</li>
                    <li>Ball may be played off the net during a volley and on a serve.</li>
                    <li>A ball hitting a boundary line is in.</li>
                    <li>A ball is out if it hits an antennae, the floor completely outside the court, any of the net or cables outside the antennae, the referee stand or pole, or the ceiling above a non-playable area.</li>
                    <li>It is legal to contact the ball with any part of a player’s body.</li>
                    <li>It is illegal to catch, hold or throw the ball.</li>
                    <li>A player cannot block or attack a serve from on or inside the 10-foot line.</li>
                    <li>After the serve, front-line players may switch positions at the net.</li>
                    <li>Matches are made up of sets; the number depends on level of play.</li>
                </p>
                <h3>Rule Violations</h3>
                <p>Committing any of these volleyball rule violations results in a point for the opponent.<br>
                    Stepping on or across the service line when serving while making contact with the ball.<br>
                    Failure to serve the ball over the net successfully.<br>
                    Ball-handling errors and contacting the ball illegally (double touching, lifting, carrying, throwing, etc.)<br>
                    Touching the net with any part of the body while the ball is in play.<br>
                    Blocking a ball coming from the opponent’s court and contacting the ball when reaching over the net if your opponent has not used 3 contacts AND has a player there to make a play on the ball.<br>
                    Attacking a ball coming from the opponent’s court and contacting the ball when reaching over the net when the ball has not yet broken the vertical plane of the net.<br>
                    Crossing the court centerline with any part of your body, with the exception of a hand or foot. It is only considered a violation if the entire hand or entire foot crosses the court centerline.<br>
                    Serving out of rotation or out of order.<br>
                    Back row player blocking (deflecting a ball coming from the opponent) when, at the moment of contact, the back row player is near the net and has part of their body above the top of the net. This is an illegal block.<br>
                    Back row player attacking a ball inside the front zone (the area inside the 3M/10-foot line) when, at the moment of contact, the ball is completely above the net. This is an illegal attack.<br>
                </p>
                <h3>Player Positions</h3>
                <h4>Setter(S)</h4><p>The setter is the main contributor to the offense of the volleyball team. One of the requirements of the setter is having a delicate touch to set the ball perfectly for one of the attacking players. Communication is extremely important for the setter because they need to get the rest of the players on the same page. Without the setter, there wouldn’t be hard spikes or technical ball movement.</p><br><br>
                <h4>Outside Hitter(OH/LH)</h4><p>The outside hitter is also known as the left-side hitter and is the lead attacker in the offensive strategy. To be a successful outsider hitter, you must be able to jump high, be quick on your feet, and be ready to adapt to different situations. The volleyball won’t always be placed where the outsider hitter would like, so they need to be prepared for hits from a variety of places.</p><br><br>
                <h4>Opposite Hitter(OPP/RH)</h4><p>Also known as the right-side hitter, these players need to be a perfect balance of both offense and defense. They will also get many opportunities to hit the volleyball, so similar to the outside hitter, jumping ability is vital. The main difference that sets the opposite hitter apart is their defensive responsibility. Being able to receive the serve from the opposing team is just one of the many requirements of this specialized position.</p><br><br>
                <h4>Middle Blocker(MB)</h4><p>The middle blocker, sometimes known as the middle hitter, is the tallest player on the volleyball team. Their main role for the team is being the first line of defense against the opposing team’s hits. The middle blocker needs to read the other team’s attackers to quickly raise his or her arms above the net in a blocking attempt. However, this is not a defense-only position. The middle blocker will have chances for quick points throughout the set.</p><br><br>
                <h4>Libero(L)</h4><p>The libero can become confusing for non-volleyball players. They can only play on the back row of the court, and because of this, are the ideal person to receive a hit from the opposite team. There are set rules the libero needs to follow, such as not attacking the ball at the net, playing a set for an attacker from the front, and more. You can always tell a libero apart from the rest of the team because they wear a different colored jersey.</p><br><br>
                <h4>Defensive Specialist(DS)</h4><p>The thing that sets the defensive specialist apart from other volleyball positions is their ability to substitute out any player on the court. This will count against the team’s total of 12 substitutions. The defensive specialist traditionally focuses on ball control and passing and works well with the libero.</p><br><br>
                <h4>Serving Specialist(SS)</h4><p>A serving specialist is a player who subs in just to serve. These players typically have a very tough or very consistent serve, and they come in for a player who is less strong behind the service line, but otherwise very valuable to have on the court as an offensive or defensive threat.</p><br>
